I LOST MY OWN BOY, Treelore, right before I started waiting on Miss Leefolt. He was twenty

He had him a little apartment over on Foley Street. Seeing a real
 
nice girl name Frances and I spec they was gone 
get married, but he was slow bout
 
things like that. Not cause he looking for something better, just cause he the thinking kind. Wore big glasses and 
reading all the time. He even start writing
 
his own book, 
bout being a colored man living and working in Mississippi. Law, that made me proud. But one night he

work, 
too skinny, but he needed the job. He
 

his lungs fore he could move. By the
 
time I found out, he was dead.
 
 
That was the day my
 
whole world went black. Air look black, sun look black. I laid up in bed and stared at the black 
walls a my house. Minny came ever
 
day to make sure I was still breathing, feed me food to keep me living. Took three months fore I even look out the 
window, s

Miss Leefolt eight to four, six day

Hilly and Elizabeth and I have been best friends since Power Elementary. My favorite photograph is of the three of us 
sitting in the football stands in junior
high, all jammed together, shoulder to shoulder. What makes the p
icture, though, is that the stands are completely 
empty around us. We sat close
 
because we were close.
 
 
At Ole Miss, Hilly and I roomed together for two years before she left to get married and I stayed on to graduate. I 
rolled thirteen curlers in her hair
 
every
 
night at the Chi Omega house. But today, she threatened to throw me out of the League. Not that I care so much 
about the League, but I was hurt by how

kids have walked and played along
 
that mile stretch, kicking at the red dust, making their way toward the big County Road 49 to catch a ride.

She kept her thu

meant white people. And even though I
 
still felt miserable, and knew that I was, most likely, ugly, it was the first time she ever talked to me like I was

choice in what I could believe.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSTANTINE CAME TO WORK in our house at six in the morning, and at harvest time, she came at five. That way 
she could fix Daddy his biscuits and
 
gravy before he headed to the field. I woke up nearly every day to her standing in the kitchen, Preacher Green
 
playing on the radio that sat on the kitchen
 


 
told the future.
 
 


 
 

 
 
Mother ate her breakfast early in the dining room, then moved to the relaxing room to do needlepoint or write letters 
to missionarie
s in Africa. From her
 
green wing chair, she could see everyone going almost anywhere in the house. It was shocking what she could 
process about my appearance in the split
 
second it took for me to pass by that door. I used to dash by, feeling like a dartboa

pinged darts at.
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
I lea

we lived too far out to have any white
 

allowed to spend the night out or have
 
company every other weekend. I grumbled over this plenty. I took Constantine for granted at times, but I think I knew, 
for the most part, how lucky I was to
 
have her there.

elbows were absolutely black, with a dry

were orangey

WHEN IT Was MY Turn to go off to college, Mother cried her eyes out when Daddy and I pulled away in the truck. But 
I felt free. I was off the farm, out from
 
under the criticism. I wanted to ask Mother, 

ve to worry

wart 
over me every day anymore?
 
But
 
Mother looked miserable.
 
 
I was the happiest person in my freshman dorm. I wrote Constantine a letter once a week, telling her about my room, 
the classes, the sorority. I had to mail
 
her letters to the farm s

Twice a month, Constantine wrote me
 
back on parchment paper that folded into an envelope. Her handwriting was large and lovely, although it ran at a 
crooked angle d
own the page. She wrote
 
me every mundane detail of Longleaf: 

 
or 
The mixer broke off 
from the bowl and flew wild around
 

 

 
me that Daddy had a chest cold or 
that Rosa Parks was coming to her
 
church to speak. Often she demanded to know if I was happy and the details of this. Our letters were like a yearlong 
conversation, answering questions
 
back and forth, continuing face

I pull out the next letter and, just as quickly, she answers it. After four or five, I exhale, relieved.
 
 

 
 


 
 
I gather up my papers and take a last sip of my Coke, letting myself relax for five seconds before I have to go write

One a

come home. I walk past the relaxing
 

en. I hear 
the words 
Ole Miss
 
and on the fuzzy
 
screen I see white men in dark suits crowding the camera, sweat running off their bald heads. I come closer and see 
a Negro man, about my age,
 
standing in the middle of the white men, with Army men behind him. The picture pans back and there is my old 
admi
nistration building. Governor Ross
 
Barnett stands with his arms crossed, looking the tall Negro in the eye. Next to the governor is our Senator Whitworth, 

 
me up with on a blind date.
 
 
I watch the television, riveted. Ye
t I am neither thrilled nor disappointed by the news that they might let a colored man 
into Ole Miss, just surprised.
 
Pascagoula, though, is breathing so loud I can hear her. She stands stock

The Ole Miss versus LSU football game

into a chair, not so frail after all, and
 

 
the Magic Soft & Silky Shinalator for

She rubs the cream in my hair with both hands. I can practically feel the hope in her fingers. A cream will not 
straighten my nose or take a foot off my
 

nslucent eyebrows, nor add weight to my bony frame. And my teeth 
are already perfectly straight. So this is
 
all she has left to fix, my hair.

I search throu

I grab it, excited to deliver it to Aibileen, but when I open it, I see the middle section has been 
ripped out. Inside, someone has written

The booklet is simply a list of laws stating what colored people can and cannot do, in an assortment of Southern 
states. I skim the first page, puzzled why
 
this is here. The laws are neither threatening nor 
friendly, just citing the facts:
 
 
 
 
 
No person shall require any white female to nurse in wards or rooms in which negro men are placed.
 
 
It shall be unlawful for a white person to marry anyone except a white person. Any marriage in violation of this sectio
n 
shall be void.
 
 
No colored barber shall serve as a barber to white women or girls.
 
 
The officer in charge shall not bury any colored persons upon ground used for the burial of white persons.
 
 
Books shall not be interchangeable between the white and color
ed schools, but shall continue to be used by the race 
first using them.
 
 
 
 
 
I read through four of the twenty
-
five pages, mesmerized by how many laws exist to separate us. Negroes and whites 
are not allowed to share water
 
fountains, movie houses, public re
strooms, ballparks, phone booths, circus shows. Negroes cannot use the same 
pharmacy or buy postage stamps at the
 
same window as me. I think about Constantine, the time my family took her to Memphis with us and the highway had

her eyes to the brown curtains, pinned
 
tight across the window. But I see it, the flicker on her mouth, a hint of softness beneath her 
anger. Minny has made

And all of them, at some point, look

Louvenia tells me how her

about it in the paper as Louvenia

find dull and vapid and have never pai

We step into the foyer and the first thi

twirl of the staircase and it is as if we
 
are inside a gigantic seashell.

Mother follows him out and I
 
give one last glance up at the sparkling chandelier. As I turn, I catch the maid staring at

FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, I submerge myself in the interviews. I keep my typewriter on the back porch and 
work most of the day long and into the
 
night. The screens give the green yar

am not here. I am in the old Jackson
 
kitchens with the maids, hot and sticky in their white uniforms. I feel the gentle bodies of white babies breathing

Celia goes to the coffee percolator, pours two cups, but then stops. Looks at me kind of surprised.
 
 

 
 

 
 
She drops t

I run to the back door, flip the lock on. I dart to the front door and lock it, ducking down when I pass the back window. 
I stand up on my tiptoes, peek

Her lips move as she calculates. But

When I tell him about the colored maids filing past me after the prayer meeting, I feel a swell of pride

bourbon glass.
 
 
Then I tell him that the manuscript has been sent to New York. That if they decide to publish it, it would come out in, 
my guess is, eight months, maybe
 
sooner. Right around the time, I think to myself, an engagement would turn into a wedding.

THAT NIGHT, after Stuart has left, I wander from room to room, dry

Stuart left me the first time. Cold is
 
what I got.
 
 

 
 

 
 
I walk down the hall. The door is half open and Mother is sitting up in her starchy white nightgown. Her hair is down 
around her shoulders. I am struck by
 
h
ow beautiful she looks. The back porch light is on, casting a white halo around her entire body. She smiles and her 
new dentures are still in, the ones Dr.
 
Simon cast for her when her teeth starting eroding from the stomach acid. Her smile is whiter, even,
 
than in her teen 
pageant pictures.
 
 

 
 

 
 
I go to her quietly. Daddy is a long sleeping lump, his back to her. And I think, I could tell her a better version of 
tonight

 
could make her happy in her last days, pretend that the wedding is going to happen.

I nod, listening, with the same numbness as my father a moment ago.
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
She slides her palms across each other, as if throwing the cancer away. Sitting straight and prim in her gown, the halo 
of light glowing around her hair, I

Even Minny look stunned. Just two months ago the white library started letting colored people in. I been in twice

scrubbing day and
 
I want to just get my mind off it all. I 
heave myself into the car and drive out to
 
Madison County. Miss Celia went to see another doctor yesterday afternoon to find out about having kids and I about 
told her, you can have this one, lady.
 

tell me every last detail about it today. At least the fool had the sense to quit that Doctor Tate.
 
 
I pull up to the house. I get to park in front now since Miss Celia finally dropped the ruse and told Mister Johnny what 
he already knew. The first thing I
 
see
 

 
 


 
here.
 
 
I lean close to the door and hear Mister Johnny, home on a weekday at 8:30 in the morning, and a voice in my head 
says run right back out the door. Miss
 


Celia call.
 
 

Johnny setting next to her. They both look
 
up at me.
 
 
Mister Johnny looks whiter than that old albino man that
 
lives behind Miss Walters.
 
 

 
 
I get him the water and take it to him. When I set the glass down on the napkin, Mister Johnny stands up. He gives 
me a long, heavy look. Lord, here it
 
comes.
 
 

 
 

 


 
 
I look over at Miss Celia and she looks dead in the eyes. I already know what that doctor told her. I can see it, that 

 
alive
. Mister Johnny squeezes my hands, then he goes to her. He gets down on his kneecaps and lays his head 
down in her lap. She smoothes his hair
 
over and over.

how many children she had, she would hold up her fingers and say three. She meant us: my sister, Susan, my

THE RASH OF negative accounts about Mississippi, in the movies, in the papers, on television, have made us 
natives a wary, defensive bunch. We are
 
full of pride and shame, but mostly pride.
 
 
Still, I got out of there. I moved to New York City when I was twenty

Mississippi is like my mother. I am allowed to complain about her all I want, but God help the person who raises an ill 
word about her around me, unless
 
she is their mother too.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I WROTE THE HELP while living in New York, which I think was easier 
than writing it in Mississippi, staring in the face 
of it all. The distance added
 
perspective. In the middle of a whirring, fast city, it was a relief to let my thoughts turn slow and remember for a while.
 
 
The Help
 
is fiction, by and large. Still, as I wr
ote it, I wondered an awful lot what my family would think of it, and what 
Demetrie would have thought too,
 
even though she was long dead. I was scared, a lot of the time, that I was crossing a terrible line, writing in the voice 
of a black person. I was a
fraid I would
 
fail to describe a relationship that was so intensely influential in my life, so loving, so grossly stereotyped in American 
history and literature.

There is no trickier subject for a writer from the South than that of affection between a black person and a white one 
in the unequal world of
 
segregation. For the dishonesty upon which a society is founded makes every emotion suspect, makes it impossi
ble 
to know whether what flowed
 
between two people was honest feeling or pity or pragmatism.
 
 
 
 
 
I read that and I thought, 
How did he find a way to put it into such concise words?
 
Here was the same slippery issue

the company of others in my struggle.
 
 
Like my feelings for Mississippi, my feelings for 
The Help
 
conflict greatly. Regarding the lines between black and 
white women, I am afraid I have told too
 
much. I was taught not to talk about such uncomfortable things, that it was tacky, impolite, they might hear us.
 
 
I am afraid I have told too little. Not just
 
that life was so much worse for many black women working in the homes in 
Mississippi, but also that there was so
 
much more love between white families and black domestics than I had the ink or the time to portray.
